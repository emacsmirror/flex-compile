## Usage

This isn't useful by itself, you need to extend but subclassing eieio (Emacs
Lisp) objects.  See the [buffer shell](https://github.com/plandes/bshell)
project for an example.  This is doen by extending Emacs `eieio` objects and
can be done in ~90 lines of code
(example: [buffer shell](https://github.com/plandes/bshell)).

To create your own managed buffer set you must extend `buffer-entry` that
defines behavior for each created managed buffer.  You must also extend the
manager itself `compile-flexr`.
