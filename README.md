Run, evaluate and compile functionality for a variety of different languages
and modes.  The specific "compilation" method is different across each add-on
library, which are called *flexible compilers*.  For example, for ESS and
Clojure you can evaluate a specific file and/or evaluate a specfic expression
via a REPL.  For running a script or starting a `make` an async process is
started.

The top level library `compile-flex` library provides a plugin architecture for
add-on libraries, which include:
* compile-flex-make
* compile-flex-beanshell
* compile-flex-script
* compile-flex-maven
* compile-flex-clojure
* compile-flex-scala
* compile-flex-command
* compile-flex-python
* compile-flex-ess


## Usage

Most flexible compilers define a specific source file called the *config* file
in *compile flex* parlance.

There are four operations:
* **Compile** (`C-x C-u`): This is the default *make something* command.  For
  make it invokes the first target, for REPL languages like Clojure and ESS it
  evaluates a `.clj` or `.r` file.
* **Run** (`C-x C-i`): This starts invokes a `run` target for make, starts the
  REPL for REPL type languages.
* **Clean** (`C-x C-y`): This invokes the `clean` target for make and kills the
  REPL for REPL based compilers.
* **Set Config File** (`C-u C-x C-i`): This sets the *config* file, which is the
  `Makefile`, `.clj`, `.r`, `.sh` file etc. *compile*, run or interpret.  Note
  that the prefix `C-u` isn't needed for some compilers like the `script`
  compiler.
* **Go to Config File** (`C-x C-i`): This pops the *config* file/buffer to the
  current buffer.

Add the following to your `~/.emacs` file:
```lisp
(require 'compile-flex)
```
This loads the file and creates global key bindings.

For each specific *flexible* compilation method you want:
```lisp
(eval-after-load
    "compile-flex"
  '(progn
     (require 'compile-flex-make)
     (require 'compile-flex-script)
     (require 'compile-flex-clojure)
     (require 'compile-flex-scala)
     (require 'compile-flex-command)
     (require 'compile-flex-python)
     (require 'compile-flex-ess)))
```

Now select a which *compilation* library you'd like to use with `C-x -C-p` and
then auto complete the library name.
